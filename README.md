# eda-data-visualizations-in-the-health-sciences
A code repository for my capstone project for the University of Florida course PHC6791 Data Visualizations in the Health Sciences. 

The scope of this project is a brief exploratory data analysis with accompanying graphics to showcase skills in the ggplot2 R package. 
Since the referenced dataset msleep is included in the referenced packages, only the R Markdown file is included.
